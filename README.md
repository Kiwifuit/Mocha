## Why the name?
Apparently, Mocha is *JavaScript*'s original name, and thinking of Java made me think of this, so I just made it the project's name

# The Folders
There's *quite a ton* of folders here, so lemme break it down for you
## `bin`
* Where Java Classes (`*.class`) are stored.
* This folder is normally bundled because you might be too lazy to compile the source or something
## `doc`
* Where documentation for the scripts in [`src`](#src) are stored
* Files in this directory can be regenerated with the following command:
  ```
  $ javadoc ../src/**/*.java
  ```
  * Make sure that your PWD is the `doc` folder before regenerating. Not doing this will fill your shell's PWD with the docs
  * If you don't like seeing verbose text, you can run the command with the `-quiet` flag
  * If you're too lazy to cd to `docs`, here's a good alternative:
  ```
  $ cd doc/; javadoc ../src/**/*.java; cd -
  ```
## `res`
* Where resources (usually files) that are used by various scripts are stored
* Due to this, you should change your current directory to the root of the project (folder where all folders defined here are seen)
## `src`
* Where scripts are stored
* The documentation for said scripts can be found in the [`doc`](#doc) folder
* The resources that said scripts use can be found in the [`res`](#res) folder
* Pre-compiled byte-code of said scrips can be found in the [`bin`](#bin) folder

# Getting Started
If you're getting started with Java, I recommend you check out the `src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/basic` folder and ignore anything else.

If Java's your first programming language, I recommend start with [the Hello World program](src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/basic/HelloWorld.java). It's a rite of passage for all developers learning a language to begin with the basics of printing text to the terminal

If you come from a language like Python, I recommend you start with [learning what arrays are](src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/basic/Arrays.java), [how `if` statements are declared](src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/basic/LogicAndFlow.java) and [how variables are declared](src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/basic/Variables.java)

If you come from a curly-braced language like C/C++, JavaScript, etc., I recommend you check out the `src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/intermediate` folder, as it covers topics that are mostly, if not all, Java-specific, like [Abstract Classes](src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/intermediate/AbstractDoggo.java), [Interfaces](src/com/misery/mocha/tutorial/intermediate/DogInterface.java), and possibly more

If you'd like to see real-world examples on how you could use Java for, I recommend you check out `src/com/misery/mocha/` folder, [a CLI I'm currently developing written in Java](https://github.com/kiwifuit/checksum), [a collection of miscellaneous Java files that have algorithms, some math trickery (like reversing an integer without using strings)](https://github.com/kiwifuit/misc-code) and [a collection of algorithms I personally wrote](https://github.com/kiwifuit/algos)

Did you like this repository? You can *maybe* give this repo a star if you do. Not gonna force you, though.

You can make refactor the code or maybe add a couple more scripts in `examples` with a PR. I am open to contribution

(*Though I don't check my GitHub very often, and I'm busy with school, I will probably see your shiny PR when I'm free*)

Have a nice day!
